# Hash-Based Signature Schemes

This project uses the [XMSS reference implementation](https://github.com/XMSS/xmss-reference) that accompanies [RFC 8391](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8391) to implement PRF-based OTS (POTS).

## Added Implementation

### PRF-based One-Time Signature (POTS)
- A novel implementation of a one-time signature scheme based on pseudorandom functions/permutations.
- Implemented in `pots.c`


## Building and Running

### Dependencies
- OpenSSL (required for SHA-256 and SHA-512 hash functions)
  - macOS: `brew install openssl`

### Configuration
- Set `OPENSSL_PREFIX` in Makefile to your OpenSSL installation path
- macOS Homebrew installations are automatically detected

### Benchmarks
```bash
# Compare AES vs SHA performance
make benchmark/aes_hash

# Measure POTS performance (keygen, sign, verify)
make benchmark/pots

# Measure WOTS performance (keygen, sign, verify)
make benchmark/wots

# Clean built files
make clean
```

## License
This implementation extends the original XMSS reference code written by Andreas HÃ¼lsing and Joost Rijneveld. The original code and extensions are available under the CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication.

## Note
This implementation is intended for research and experimentation. Production use requires careful consideration of deployment scenarios and threat models, particularly for stateful signature schemes.
